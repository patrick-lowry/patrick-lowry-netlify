## Overview

A comprehensive computer vision project that implements automatic image stitching using homography transformations to create seamless panoramic images from multiple overlapping photographs.

## Technical Implementation

**Computer Vision Pipeline:**
- Feature detection using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- Feature matching with FLANN-based matcher for efficient correspondence
- Homography estimation using RANSAC algorithm for robust outlier rejection
- Image warping and blending for seamless panorama creation

**Core Technologies:**
